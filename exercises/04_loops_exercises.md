# Exercises: Loops (The Grind)

## Mission 1: The Countdown
Create `countdown.py`.
Use a loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.
After the loop finishes, print "Liftoff!".
*Hint: range(10, 0, -1)*

## Mission 2: Captain America's Training
Create `training.py`.
Ask the user: "How many laps?" (e.g., 5).
Use a `for` loop to print:
"Running lap 1..."
"Running lap 2..."
...
"Running lap 5..."
"On your left!"

## Mission 3: Strange's Bargain (While Loop)
Create `bargain.py`.
Create a variable `bargain_count` = 0.
Start a `while` loop that runs as long as `bargain_count` is less than 5.
Inside the loop:
- Print "Dormammu, I've come to bargain."
- Ask user input: "Does Dormammu accept? (yes/no)"
- If user types "yes": print "Universe Saved!" and **break**.
- Else: increase `bargain_count` by 1.

If the loop finishes without a "yes" (after 5 tries), print "Dormammu wins...".

## Mission 4: Even Numbers Only
Print all *even* numbers from 1 to 20 using a loop.
*Hint: Uses `% 2 == 0` or range stepping.*
