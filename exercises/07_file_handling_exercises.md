# Exercises: File Handling (The Archives)

## Mission 1: The Diary
Create `diary.py`.
1. Create a variable with a secret message (e.g., "I am Batman").
2. Write it to a file named `secret.txt`.

## Mission 2: The Intel
Create `read_intel.py`.
1. Open `secret.txt` (from Mission 1) in Read mode.
2. Print the content to the terminal.

## Mission 3: The Log (Append)
Create `logger.py`.
1. Ask the user for a "Captain's Log" entry (input).
2. Append this entry to a file `captains_log.txt`.
3. Add a newline `\n` so entries don't get squashed together.
4. Run the script multiple times to see the file grow.

## Mission 4: The Cleaning
Create `clean_slate.py`.
1. Open `captains_log.txt` in Write mode (`"w"`).
2. Write "Log Cleared."
3. (This proves that "w" deletes previous content).
