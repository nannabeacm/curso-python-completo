# Exercises: The Origin Story (Intro)

## Mission 1: The Identity Reveal
Create a python script named `identity.py`.
Print three lines of text that describe your favorite superhero *without* naming them.
**Example Output:**
```text
I am a billionaire.
I have a suit of armor.
I am a genius.
```

## Mission 2: The Signal
Open your terminal (Command Prompt / Terminal).
Navigate to the folder where you saved `identity.py`.
Run the script using the python command:
```bash
python identity.py
```

## Mission 3: The Glitch
Create a file named `glitch.py` with the following code:
```python
print("Hail Hydra"
```
Run it. Read the error message.
*Fix the code* so it runs correctly. What was missing?

## Mission 4: The Math
Python can do math. Create `calculator.py`.
Make it print the result of `2 + 2` and `10 * 10`.
Do NOT just print the string "4". Let Python do the math.
```python
print(2 + 2)
```
