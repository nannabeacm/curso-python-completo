# 01. The Origin Story: Introduction & Setup

> "It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me." - Batman

Welcome to your origin story. Every superhero needs a lair, and every programmer needs an environment. Today, we set up your Batcave.

## 1. What is Python?
Python is like the **Super Soldier Serum** of programming languages. It makes you engaged, powerful, and versatile. It's used by:
- **Stark Industries** (Automation & AI)
- **Wayne Enterprises** (Data Analysis)
- **The Daily Bugle** (Web Scraping for Spider-Man pictures)

## 2. Setting Up The Batcave (Installation)

### Installing Python
1.  Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org).
2.  Download the latest version.
3.  **IMPORTANT:** Check the box **"Add Python to PATH"**. This is like giving JARVIS access to your house systems. Without it, you'll be shouting commands into the void.

### VS Code: Your Suit
You need an interface. We will use **VS Code**.
1.  Download at [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).
2.  Install the **Python Extension** (look for the Microsoft one).

## 3. Your First Mission: Hello Hero

Open VS Code, create a file named `mission_01.py`, and type:

```python
print("I am Iron Man.")
```

Run it (Play button in top right).
If you see `I am Iron Man.` in the terminal, congratulations. You have just awakened your powers.

## 4. The Terminal (Command Line)
The terminal is your direct link to the mainframe.
- `python --version`: Check your power level.
- `python mission_01.py`: Execute your mission manually.
